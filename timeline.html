<br>
<h4 id="19171">Champaran Satyagraha </h4>
<p>
  The Champaran Satyagraha of 1917 was the first Satyagraha movement led by Gandhi in India and is considered a historically important rebellion in the Indian Freedom Struggle. It was a farmer's uprising that took place in Champaran district of Bihar, India, during the British colonial period. The farmers were protesting against having to grow indigo with barely any payment for it.
</p>
<h4 id="19172">Kheda Satyagraha</h4>
<p>
  The Kheda Satyagraha of 1918, in the Kheda district of Gujarat, India during the period of the British Raj, is a Satyagraha movement organised by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. It was a major revolt in the Indian independence movement. It was the second Satyagraha movement after Champaran Satyagraha.[1] Gandhi organised this movement to support peasants.
</p>
<h4 id="1918">Ahmedabad Mill Strike</h4>
<p>
  The Mill strike movement organised by Gandhiji along with the Kheda Movement was held in the city of Ahmedabad. It was the second largest city of Bombay Presidency and was an established commercial centre. In colonial rule, the cotton industry grew in this city and it became a modern industrial town of the 20th century.

In 1918, there was a conflict between Gujarat Mill owners and workers on the topic of Plague Bonus of 1917. The mill owners wanted to withdraw the bonus whereas the workers wanted a 50% wage hike.

Because of the above disagreement, Gandhiji led a strike in the cotton mills and he used the weapon of hunger strike. The strike was carried out in a pure non-violent disciplined way. This strike was successful and all the workers got a 35% wage increase.
</p>
<h4 id="1919"> Rowlatt Act Satyagraha </h4>
<p>
  Rowlatt Act is one of the most controversial legislative bills enacted by the British government to curtail the civil liberties of Indian people in the early twentieth century. It transformed the Indian national movement and gave prominence to Indiaâ€™s fiercest freedom fighter, Mahatma Gandhi. This bill unearthed several protests across India and also led to the most horrifying event in Indian history: the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre.

<br>
<h4 id="1920"> Khilafat Non-Cooperation Movement</h4>
<p>
The Non-Cooperation Movement was one of the most famous and crucial phases in the Indian freedom struggle against the Britishers. The major reasons due to which this movement happened are as follows:

Ill-treatment of the Khalifa, the spiritual leader of the Muslims by the Britishers agitated the entire Muslim community in India and around the world.
Deteriorating economic conditions in the country along with the major incidents like Jallianwala Bagh Massacre, Rowlatt Act, etc were the main reasons behind how it emerged to be a pivotal Indian national movement.
The Non-Cooperation Movement was officially launched by the Khilafat Committee in August 1920. Also, the Indian National Congress adopted the movement in December 1920 after their Nagpur session. After which a complete boycott of government goods, schools, colleges, food, clothing etc happened and emphasis was laid on studying at national schools and khadi products were used.

On February 5, 1922, Chauri Chaura incident took place wherein the police station along with 22 policemen inside it was burnt. This led to call-off of this Indian National Movement by Mahatama Gandhi.

<br>
<h4 id="1930">Civil Disobedience Movement </h4>
<p>
One of the most prominent Indian national movements, the Civil Disobedience phase is classified into two stages: 

<h7>First Civil Disobedience Movement</h7>
The Civil Disobedience Movement was launched along with the Dandi March by Mahatma Gandhi on 12th March 1930. Ultimately, it ended on April 6 when Gandhi broke the Salt Law at Dandi. Afterwards, the movement was proceeded by C.Raja Gopalachari.

Mass participation of women, peasants and merchants happened and was succeeded by salt satyagraha, no-tex movement and no-rent movement as this Indian national movement spread across the country. Later on, it got withdrawn in March 1931 because of the Gandhi-Irwin Pact.

<h7>Second Civil Disobedience Movement</h7>
The failed treaty of the second roundtable conference led to the start of the second Civil Disobedience Movement stretching from December 1931 to April 1934. This lead to varied practices like protests in front of liquor stores, salt satyagraha, forest law violations happened. But the British Government was aware of the upcoming incidents, thus, it imposed martial law with a ban on gatherings outside Gandhiâ€™s Ashrams.

<br>
<h4 id="1942">Quit India Movement </h4>
<p>
The main reason behind the launch of the Quit India Movement in 1942 as it became one of the powerful Indian National Movements include:

The discontent of the general public with hardships brought by the world war
